Invoicing
**********
A Python 3.4+ package that turns CSV timesheets into HTML invoices.
Use Pandas and Jinja2 to do the heavy lifting.

At this stage of development, only the most common use case is handled, namely one billing function per invoice.


Installation

- Create a Python virtual environment and ``pip install invoicing``


Usage
======
- Play with the IPython notebook and invoice template in the ``examples`` directory to get the idea
- Read the short ``main.py`` module for more details
- Better docs coming soon... 


Notes
======
- Development status is Alpha
- Project uses semantic versioning


Todo
